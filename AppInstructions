Development choices:
- I use PostgreSQL as the database for the project, mainly due to its simplicity and since it was totally sufficient for this project given the straightforward, tabular format of the data
- I run PostgreSQL through Docker to have less exposure to computing environment issues
- I use Flask to implement the web application, since it is a simple and quick way to run web apps in Python

Setup instructions:
1. First start a PostgreSQL container with Docker
	run: docker run -d --name postgresdb -p 5432:5432 postgres

	Requirements for this step: Docker installed on the computer

	(Also note: you may need to free up port 5432 beforehand!)

2. Then initialize the PostgreSQL database
	run: cat sql_db_creation.sql | docker run --net host -i postgres psql --host 0.0.0.0 --user postgres

3. Then execute the script to transfer the data from the .csv file to the database
	run: python3 data_transfer_to_DB.py

	Requirements for this step:
		- Python libraries: pandas,psycopg2, sqlalchemy 
		- Other prerequisites: The data file ('task_data.csv') should be in the same directory as data_transfer_to_DB.py

4. Then execute the script to load the data from the database, serve it in html format and log get requests into the same database
	run: python3 web_app.py

	Requirements for this step:
		- Python libraries: pandas,psycopg2, sqlalchemy, flask 
		- Other prerequisites: There should be a 'templates' folder in the same directory as web_app.py, with a file named 'simple.html' in it

5. Check the web app
	run: http://localhost:5000/ (from any HTTP-client)

6. Check the database to see the logs
	run: docker run --rm -it --net host postgres psql "$@" --host 0.0.0.0 --user postgres
